*Note:* This app was designed and optimized for mobile devices. For the best experience, please switch to mobile view or resize your browser window to simulate a mobile screen.

## Technologies Used
- *Tailwind CSS*: For rapid and modern styling.
- *HTML*: To structure the web app.

## Future Scope
While this is a frontend project, it can easily be extended into a fully functional app by integrating *JavaScript* for interactivity and backend services for managing data.
